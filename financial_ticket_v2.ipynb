My proper request must over, I was never 30 days/60 days/120 days late in any of my payments and I'm not greatly tuned in to the date opened so I prefer to ask you be investigated as soon as possible and confirmed to be correct. Thanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             7\n",

       "Chase Bank did not send me a statement. Chase Bank did not contact me until my account was 30 days past due. Since the day I received my card ( about 6 months ago ) from Chase Bank, I have not received a single statement. I'm never late on payments and never have a carryover balance on any of my credit cards. My credit score was 800+, now thanks to this unethical company it has dropped about  75 points for who knows how long. When I looked in to it, I learned my card was 0 % interest and the only way they made money off of the card was through late fees. I don't think it was a coincidence that I never received statements. I'm done with Chase and hope they're not doing this to anyone else.                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",
